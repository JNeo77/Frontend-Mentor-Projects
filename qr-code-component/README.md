## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- VS Code Editor

### What I learned

I learned simple CSS resetting in order to set yourself up for positioning elements. 

I also learned the following:
  1. The fundamentals of the CSS Box Model. Particularly the difference in behavior between the content-box and border-box values of the box-sizing property.
  2. How to use Google Fonts in my projects.
  3. How to use media queries in CSS to optimize for mobile.

### Continued development

I'd like to become more fluent with sizing and positioning elements with the CSS box model.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.web.dev/learn) - This is a great resource to learn basic semantic HTML and CSS. The focus on accessibility was very helpful. I like the teaching style and will definitely use this as a reference.
